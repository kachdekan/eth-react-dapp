# A simple Hardhat Project with react

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
Then connect the React front end to allow users to read data from the blockchain as well as create transactions with MetaMask using test Ether that we create using accounts created by our local test environment.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
